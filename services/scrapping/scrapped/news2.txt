ðŸŒŠ Ocean Within | A Yoga Gathering Inspired by The Water Edit

In celebration of Luru Magazineâ€™s The Water Edit, join us for a slow, sensory yoga practice that flows with the qualities of water â€” intuitive, rhythmic, and deeply connected.

Ocean Within is a mellow flow session: a gently guided moving meditation through Water Salutations, hip openers, and conscious breath work. Designed to soften the edges and invite fluidity in the body, this practice is a return to inner stillness- a space where youâ€™re not just the waves, but the whole ocean.

ðŸŒ€ Open to all levels. Bring your mat, your breath, and a sense of curiosity.

60 mins of Water Salutations, hip openers, and conscious breath work
